> This module contains data collected from Sentinel 2 MSI satellite constellation. The data is stored into `.csv` format. The data is initially split class-wise. Further, we have 73 images per class, covering selected geometry and 5 bands mentioned in _spatial resolution_ above. CSVs for different bands and indices are generated from this data. The indexes-csv files undergo the pre-processing pipeline.


> The Pickled Folder contains `.dat` files which store the _generalized configuration_ for every class to be used for DTW algorithm.
